    "with -r, will that affect the normal lines of simulation tho, like when you pass the -r with the .rou.xml file, the SUMO is like \"oh you passed a route file, and this file includes just a route and a car in that route, so that I will spawn just that car following thar route\", isn't it? Or actually, idk if my map file contains a specific veh-route .xml file at all, but the overall is if -r affect the naturalness of simulation?"

    "You are absolutely correct to worry about this. This is a classic SUMO configuration \"gotcha.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Short Answer:**\n",
    "Yes. If you run `sumo -c osm.sumocfg -r test_route.rou.xml`, SUMO will **replace** the background traffic defined in your `osm.sumocfg` with your new file. You will end up with an empty city and just your one car.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Explanation:**\n",
    "Your `osm.sumocfg` file contains a line inside it that looks like this:\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<route-files value=\"osm.passenger.trips.xml,osm.motorcycle.trips.xml,...\"/>\n",
    "```\n",
    "When you provide the `-r` (or `--route-files`) flag in your Python script, you are telling SUMO: *\"Ignore what is in the config file for routes, and use THIS file instead.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Fix It (To keep background traffic AND your test car)\n",
    "\n",
    "You have two easy options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Use the `-a` (Additional) flag (Recommended for you)\n",
    "In SUMO, you can load route files as \"additional files.\" SUMO will load the main config (Map + Background Traffic) and *then* add your test car on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In your Python `reset` method:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if self.test_mode:\n",
    "    active_map = self.maps[0]\n",
    "    # Use \"-a\" (Additional) instead of \"-r\". \n",
    "    # This ADDS your car to the existing simulation instead of replacing it.\n",
    "    route_arg = [\"-a\", self.test_route] \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Create a Dedicated Test Config (Best for Research)\n",
    "If you want to be very professional, you create a new config file called `test.sumocfg` inside your folder.\n",
    "In that file, you copy the contents of `osm.sumocfg` but **add** your test route to the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Inside `test.sumocfg`:*\n",
    "```xml\n",
    "<configuration>\n",
    "    <input>\n",
    "        <net-file value=\"osm.net.xml.gz\"/>\n",
    "        <!-- Add your file to the end of this list -->\n",
    "        <route-files value=\"osm.passenger.trips.xml,osm.motorcycle.trips.xml,test_route.rou.xml\"/> \n",
    "        <additional-files value=\"osm.poly.xml.gz,...\"/>\n",
    "    </input>\n",
    "</configuration>\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then in Python, you just load `active_map = \"maps/TestMap/test.sumocfg\"` and pass no extra arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "Since you want to stick to the Python script focus right now, **go with Option 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Change the line in your `reset` method back to `-a`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "route_arg = [\"-a\", self.test_route]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This tells SUMO: \"Load the map and traffic as usual, and **additionally** spawn my test vehicle.\""
